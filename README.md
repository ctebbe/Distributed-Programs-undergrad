(cs455) Networking shortest paths and homebrewed threadpool

## hw1 folder
Contains the code for a program which perform Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on a distributed network graph of live peer nodes. All networking, routing, and algorithm logic is original and does not depend on any 3rd party libraries.

## ASG2 folder
Contains the code for a program which implements a high-throughput threadpooled server from scratch. All networking, routing, and concurrency logic is original and does not depend on 3rd party libraries.
